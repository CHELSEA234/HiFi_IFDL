### Usage on Manipulation Localization (_e.g._, Columbia, Coverage, CASIA, NIST16 and IMD2020)
- To create your environment by
  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```
  or mannually install `pytorch 1.11.0` and `torchvision 0.12.0` in `python 3.7.16`.
- Go to [localization_weights_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cxCoE2hjcDj4lLrJmGEbskzPRJfoDIMJ?usp=sharing) to download the weights from, and then put them in `weights`.
- To apply the pre-trained model on images in the `./data_dir` and then obtain results in `./viz_eval`, please run
  ```
  bash HiFi_Net_loc.sh
  ```
- More quantitative and qualitative results can be found at: [csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12iS0ILb6ndXtdWjonByrgnejzuAvwCqp?usp=sharing) and [qualitative results](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iZp6ciOHSbGq4EsC_AYl7zVK24gBtrd1?usp=sharing).
- If you would like to generate the above result. Download $5$ datasets via [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RYXTg0Q82KEvkeOtaaR5AZ0FBx5219SY/view?usp=sharing) and unzip it by `tar -xvf data.tar.gz`. Then, uncomment this [line](https://github.com/CHELSEA234/HiFi_IFDL/blob/main/utils/load_edata.py#L21) and run `HiFi_Net_loc.sh`. 

### Usage on the detection and localization in the HiFi-IFDL dataset (Tab. 2 and Supplementary Fig.1):
- Go to [HiFi_IFDL_weights_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v07aJ2hKmSmboceVwOhPvjebFMJFHyhm?usp=sharing) to download the weights, and then put them in `weights`. 
- The quick usage on HiFi_Net:
```python
  from HiFi_Net import HiFi_Net 
  from PIL import Image
  import numpy as np

  HiFi = HiFi_Net()   # initialize
  img_path = 'asset/sample_1.jpg'

  ## detection
  res3, prob3 = HiFi.detect(img_path)
  # print(res3, prob3) 1 1.0
  HiFi.detect(img_path, verbose=True)

  ## localization
  binary_mask = HiFi.localize(img_path)
  binary_mask = Image.fromarray((binary_mask*255.).astype(np.uint8))
  binary_mask.save('pred_mask.png')
```

### Question and Answers.
Q1. Why train and val datasets are in the same path? 

A1. For each forgery method, we save both train and val in the SAME folder, from which we use a text file to obtain the training and val images. The text file contains a list of image names, and the first `val_num` are used for training and the last "val_num" for validation. Specifically, refer to [code](https://github.com/CHELSEA234/HiFi_IFDL/blob/main/utils/load_data.py#L271) for details. What is more, we build up the code on the top of the PSCC-Net, which adapts the same style of loading data, please compare [code1](https://github.com/proteus1991/PSCC-Net/blob/main/utils/load_tdata.py#L88) with [code2](https://github.com/proteus1991/PSCC-Net/blob/main/utils/load_tdata.py#L290).

Q2. What is the dataset naming for STGAN and the face-shifter section?

A2. Please check the STGAN.txt in this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OIUv7OGxfAyerMnmKvrNnN_5CmIDcNxo?usp=sharing), which contains all manipulated/modified images we have used for training and validation. This txt file will be loaded by this line of [code](https://github.com/CHELSEA234/HiFi_IFDL/blob/main/utils/load_data.py#L163), which says about the corresponding masks. Lastly, I am not sure if I have release the authentic images, if I do not, you can simply find them in the public celebAHQ dataset. I will try to offer the rigid naming for the dataset in the near future.
